# Gavin Dhanda

Hi! I'm a Junior at Brown University pursuing an Sc.B in Computer Science and an AB in Business Economics. This site contains some of my notable software engineering and design projects—both professional and personal—and a brief resume of my experience and education.

If you have any questions or would like to connect, please reach out! I'd love to discuss any and all opportunities.
