# Website Description

import ProjectPage from '../../components/proj_pages'

<ProjectPage src="/images/projects/website.jpg" alt="Portfolio Website" gitLink="https://github.com/gavin-dhanda/portfolio"/>

I wrote this portfolio website in React and Next.js, using MDX for content management. The website is hosted on Vercel with a custom domain, and is designed to be responsive and accessible, with a focus on clean design and fast load times. 

This project builds on my experience in UI/UX and web design from CS32. For implementation details, feel free to review the source code linked above on GitHub.
