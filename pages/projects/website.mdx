# Website Description

import ProjectPage from '../../components/proj_pages'

<ProjectPage src="/images/projects/website.jpg" alt="Portfolio Website" gitLink="https://github.com/gavin-dhanda/portfolio"/>

I wrote this portfolio website in React and Next.js, using MDX for content management. The website is hosted on Vercel and uses a custom domain. The website is designed to be responsive and accessible, with a focus on clean design and fast load times.
