BloonsTD15 is a custom recreation of the Bloons Tower Defense game series, developed as a CS15 final project. It features tower defense gameplay mechanics with animated monkey defenses, diverse bloon types, and strategic elements. The project is optimized for IntelliJ IDEA.

<h3> Key Features </h3>

<h4> Game Structure: </h4> <p> Core classes manage the layout (PaneOrganizer), game logic (BloonsGame), money tracking, and game elements like darts and bloons. </p>
<h4> Bloon Management with LinkedList: </h4> <p> A doubly linked list stores bloons, enabling efficient reordering based on track position and flexible targeting options for monkeys. </p>
<h4> Monkey Class Inheritance: </h4> <p> An inheritance structure for different monkey types allows shared functionality while handling unique shooting styles and upgrades. </p>
<h4> Visuals and Animations: </h4> <p> Monkeys use composite shapes and imported images, with animations for actions like dart shooting, explosions, and bloon popping. </p>

<h3> Game Mechanics </h3>

- New bloons include basic colored bloons, camo and lead types, along with an "A.N.D.Y. Bloon" as a final challenge.
- The game includes 30 increasingly challenging levels, stored in memory as a 3D array designating bloon waves and type.
- Monkeys display a range circle that turns red when placement is restricted, providing immediate feedback.
