A wardrobe management website, Fit-Me-UP! suggests outfits based on users' existing clothing items. Its algorithm customizes recommendations by factoring in color, weather, formality, and styling guidelines. Users can save and access their wardrobe and favorite outfits using Google authentication, enabling cross-login continuity.

<h4> Backend Functionality: </h4> <p> Clothing and outfit manipulation is handled by Firebase-integrated back-end handlers for adding, listing, and removing items. </p>

<h4> Outfit Generation: </h4> <p> Outfits are generated through a compatibility-based algorithm that evaluates color, weather, and material to recommend coherent looks. </p>

<h4> Weather API Integration: </h4> <p> Weather-based recommendations enhance outfit selection, modifying options based on current local conditions. </p>
