Unfortunately, I am unable to share the code for this project as it is proprietary to Volley Automation. However, I can share the process and the technologies used in the project.

The Proto-Gantry project is a small-scale prototype designed to locate and approach an EV-charging adapter using a gantry system combined with an OAK machine vision camera. Key components include a YOLOv7 model for object detection, spatial processing scripts, and TCP-based gantry control.

<h3> Conceptual Techniques </h3>

<h4> Computer Vision with YOLOv7: </h4> <p> Skills include image dataset creation, annotation, and custom object detection model training using YOLOv7 on platforms like Google Colab, along with applying preprocessing and dataset management for object detection tasks. </p>

<h4>Camera-Driven Object Localization: </h4> <p> Techniques for using an OAK camera to capture spatial data, detecting and tracking objects, calculating spatial coordinates, and translating those into actionable movements within a robotic gantry system. </p>

<h4>Embedded System Control with TCP Communication: </h4> <p> Embedded programming to control motorized systems through TCP commands, emphasizing real-time communication, motor homing, and precision movements, along with implementing input parsing and error handling. </p>

<h4>System Integration and Testing: </h4> <p> Skills in setting up hardware connections, addressing common challenges with motor responsiveness and network latency, and calibrating camera-based spatial detection within a physical range. </p>
