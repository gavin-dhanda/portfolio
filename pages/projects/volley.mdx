Unfortunately, I am unable to share the code for this project as it is proprietary to Volley Automation. However, I can share the process and the technologies used in the project.

A fully integrated 2D gantry system, powered by Arduino, controlled through Ethernet, and using Computer Vision to identify a unique target.
