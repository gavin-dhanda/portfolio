An adaptation of a favorite game, Minecraft, for my Computer Graphics final project. Features a procedurally generated 3D world with dynamic terrain, efficient chunk management, and responsive controls, all rendered in real-time with custom lighting and shading effects.

<h3> Technical Features </h3>

<h4> Procedural Terrain and Structure Generation: </h4> <p> Developed a dynamic terrain system using fractal noise to create varied landscapes, with randomized tree and water placements for realistic world-building. </p>

<h4> Efficient Chunk Management: </h4> <p> Implemented a chunk-based system that dynamically loads and unloads terrain sections based on player position, optimizing memory usage and maintaining smooth performance. </p>

<h4> Real-Time 3D Rendering with OpenGL: </h4> <p> Utilized shaders and framebuffer objects for efficient rendering, including Phong lighting for realistic shading and texture mapping for terrain differentiation (e.g., sand, water, grass). </p>

<h4> Responsive Camera and Player Controls: </h4> <p> Created fluid camera movements with WASD control, mouse-based rotations, jump mechanics, and water movement for an engaging first-person experience. </p>

<h4> Customizable Lighting System: </h4> <p> Designed a dynamic lighting setup with torch placements that illuminate the environment, providing customizable light positions and attenuations based on player interactions. </p>
